# IMPART - *I*nteractive *M*ulti-*P*hysics *A*nalysis in *R*eal-*T*ime

**IMPART** is an **I**nteractive **M**ulti-**P**hysics **A**nalysis engine designed to run in **R**eal-**T**ime, created primarily for educational purposes.

As a demonstration of the project's core capabilities, an interactive steak cooking simulator has been developed which incorporates the effects of radiative and conductive heat transfer, contact between rigid and deformable bodies, and temperature-driven shrinkage caused by moisture loss. You can experiment with the [live demo here](https://bdgiffin.github.io/stf/)! The basic controls are explained below:
 - `c`: Toggle the color visualization scheme between the visible light spectrum and the IR spectrum.
 - `r`: Restart the simulation from the beginning.
 - `+`: Increase the stove setting to generate more heat.
 - `-`: Decrease the stove setting to generate less heat.
 - Up/Down arrow keys: Induce stretching in the steak's longer dimension.
 - Left/Right arrow keys: Induce stretching in the steak's shorter dimension.
 - Mouse: Click and drag the frying pan to move it around.
